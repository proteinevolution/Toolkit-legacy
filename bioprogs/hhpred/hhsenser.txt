To find even remotely homologous members of the AbrB-like superfamily we used our newly developed method HHsenser. 
HHsenser is an intermediate profile search method that is based on HMM-HMM comparison for maximum sensitivity.
HHsenser first employs straight PSI-BLAST to generate an initial alignment of relatively close homologs of the query sequence (AbrB, in our case). It then selects representative sequences (maximum pairwise sequence identity of 40%) in the vicinity of the query sequence -- in this case with PSI-BLAST E-values up to 1 -- as seeds for building new alignments with PSI-BLAST. HMM-HMM comparison (HHsearch) is employed to check if the new alignment is homologous to the superalignment of all accepted homologs of the query sequence. If the alignment is accepted it included in the superalignment. In addition, the representative sequences in the vicinity of the newly accepted alignment are added to the list of seed sequences. For each seed sequence an alignment will be constructed with PSI-BLAST. The process continues until all seeds have been processed. A series of heuristics ensures that run-time is kept to a minimum by avoiding PSI-BLAST searches that will probably not result in a homologous alignment. The AbrB superfamily alignment was generated in 8.5 hours on a single 3GHz 64-bit AMD CPU.
