   /* General Notes
    * It is important to remember that all functions that accept an argument of type "const char *" will also
    * accept "char *", this is done so you can have a changing filename (to make many PNG images in series 
    * with a different name, for example), and to allow you to use string type objects which can be easily 
    * turned into const char * (if theString is an object of type string, then it can be used as a const char *
    * by saying theString.c_str()).
    * It is also important to remember that whenever a function has a colour coeffiecient as its argument, 
    * that argument can be either an int from 0 to 65535 or a double from 0.0 to 1.0. 
    * It is important to make sure that you are calling the function with the type that you want.
    * Remember that 1 is an int, while 1.0 is a double, and will thus determine what version of the function 
    * will be used. Similarly, do not make the mistake of calling for example plot(x, y, 0.0, 0.0, 65535),
    * because
    * there is no plot(int, int, double, double, int).
    * */
   
   /* Constructor
    * The constructor requires the width and the height of the image, the background colour for the
    * image and the filename of the file (a pointer or simple "myfile.png"). The background colour
    * can only be initialized to a shade of grey (once the object has been created you can do whatever 
    * you want, though), because generally one wants either a white (65535 or 1.0) or a black (0 or 0.0)
    * background to start with.
    * Tip: The filename can be given as easily as:
    * pngwriter mypng(300, 300, 0.0, "myfile.png");    
    * Tip: If you are going to create a PNGwriter instance for reading in a file that already exists, 
    * then width and height can be 1 pixel, and the size will be automatically adjusted once you use
    * readfromfile().

    * With this function a pixel at coordinates (x, y) can be set to the desired colour. 
    * The pixels are numbered starting from (1, 1) and go to (width, height). 
    * As with most functions in PNGwriter, it has been overloaded to accept either int arguments 
    * for the colour coefficients, or those of type double. If they are of type int, 
    * they go from 0 to 65535. If they are of type double, they go from 0.0 to 1.0.
    * Tip: To plot using red, then specify plot(x, y, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0). To make pink, 
    * just add a constant value to all three coefficients, like this:
    * plot(x, y, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0). 
    * Tip: If nothing is being plotted to your PNG file, make sure that you remember
    * to close() the instance before your program is finished, and that the x and y position
    * is actually within the bounds of your image. If either is not, then PNGwriter will 
    * not complain-- it is up to you to check for this!
