http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/forester/




2. Unpacking FORESTER
---------------------

Unix, Linux:

  "uncompress forester.tar.Z"

  followed by:

(such as "class not found") you might want to inspect your
CLASSPATH with "echo $CLASSPATH". Please make sure it
contains a path to the current directory (".", "./") or a path
to FORESTER. Alternatively, you could use
the "-classpath" option.

     "javac forester/tools/*java"


 o   ATVapp (requires JDK 1.2 or greater):
