Search with an amino acid sequence against protein databases for locally similar sequences. Similar to ProteinBLAST but more sensitive. PSI-BLAST first performs a BLAST search and builds an alignment from the best local hits. This alignment is then used as a query for the next round of search. After each successive round the search alignment is updated.
