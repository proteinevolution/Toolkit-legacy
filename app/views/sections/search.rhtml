<h4><a target="_blank" href="/pdbalert">PDBalert</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
PDBalert is a web-based automatic system that alerts users as soon as a pdb structure with homology to a protein of interest becomes available. Users can upload their personal protein sequences of interest. Once a week, when new proteins are released to the PDB database, PDBalert compares these with the users' sequences. When a significant match is found, the user is alerted by an email containing a link to the search results.

<h3 class="search">External servers for protein family search</h3>		

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/">InterPro</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Search your protein with the InterPro database of protein families, domains and 
	functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can 
	be applied to unknown protein sequences. InterPro contains many databases of
	HMMs or patterns, such as Pfam, PANTHER, SMART, TIGRFAMs, PIRSF, PRODOM, CATH, SUPERFAMILY, 
	PRINTS, and PROSITE.	
</p>
<div class="hr">&nbsp;</div>

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/">Pfam</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Search your protein sequence with the Pfam database of HMMs for known protein
	domains (including modular domains and repeat families). The Pfam database 
	contains a large collection of curated and relatively well-annotated alignments/HMMs.
</p>
<div class="hr">&nbsp;</div>

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de">SMART</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Search your protein sequence with the SMART database of HMMs for known modular 
	domains and repeat families. The database alignments/HMMs are hand-curated and very 
	well annotated.
</p>
<div class="hr">&nbsp;</div>

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/papers/rep/search.html">REP</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Search your protein sequence with a database of HMMs for known repeat families, such as
	Ankyrin, Armadillo, HAT, HEAT, Kelch, LRR, PFTA, PFTB, RCC1, TPR, WD40.

<h3 class="search">External servers for linear motif search</h3>		

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELM</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Prediction of Eukarytic Linear Motifs, a special class of functional sites in 
	eukaryotic proteins. Putative functional sites are identified by patterns. To 
	improve the predictive power, context-based rules and logical filters are applied.
</p>
<div class="hr">&nbsp;</div>

<h4><a target="_blank" href="http://scansite.mit.edu/abtscansite.phtml">ScanSite</a></h4>
<p class="tooldescr">
	Search your protein for motifs likely to be physphorylated by a specific protein kinases 
	or to bind to domains such as SH2 domains, 14-3-3 domains or PDZ domains. Uses 
	sequence profiles instead of patterns.
