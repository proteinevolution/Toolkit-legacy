   <BR/><h5><br>ClubSub-P is clustering based meta-prediction of subcellular localization (SCL) database for Gram-negative bacterial and Archaeal proteins.<BR/></h5>
<P>Newly synthesized proteins have to be translocated to its native subcellular compartments for performing its native function. 
This protein sorting across the cytoplasmic membrane usually requires a short stretch of secretory signals which are present at 
the N-terminal region of proteins. But there are few secretory pathways in Gram-negative bacteria which do not require a secretory signal for secretion.</P></BR>

<P>In the post genomic era, SCL prediction is an important step in the functional annotation of proteins. The quality of secretory 
signal peptide predictions not only depends on the tools, but also depends on the quality of the input sequences. There are instances 
where the start codon is mis-predicted, a wrong N-terminal end which leads to a false positive or false negative signal peptide prediction. 
This further leads to a wrong SCL annotation.</P></BR>

<P>The mis-prediction of signal peptide due to the start codon prediction errors can be reduced by integrating the signal peptide prediction 
from closely related sequences. To achieve this 157 Gram-negative bacterial proteomes and 67 Archaeal proteomes were clustered separately and 
N-terminal signal peptide and secondary structural features were predicted. Then SCL were assigned to proteins, which is later combined at cluster 
level to get SCL of the cluster.</P></BR>

<H3 class="<%= @section["name"]%>">Clustering</H3>
   <BR/><A href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/" target="_blank">CD-HIT</A> program was used for clustering the proteomes at 40% local sequence 
identity and 80% coverage cutoffs to the longest representative sequence in the cluster. 
CD-HIT user's guide can be found <A href="http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/wiki/doku.php?id=cd-hit_user_guide" target="_blank">here</A> and 
following was the command used to cluster the proteomes,<BR/><BR/>

   <P><B>Lipoprotein signal peptide</B>
      <BR>'Best prediction' in LipoP 1.0 was used to identify the <B>Lipoprotein signal peptides</B> in proteins. Since +2 retention signals are species specific 
and there is no enough experimental evidence to for a better classifier yet, so the sequence after SPII cleavage site was provided in the results for user's 
interpretation to predict which membranei (inner/outer) the protein binds.

      <BR>Both TatP 1.0 and TatFind 1.4 should give a positive prediction to identify <B>TAT signal peptides</B>. 
TatP's MaxD score was used to confirm the TAT signal peptide's cleavage.

   <P><B>General signal peptide</B>
      <BR><B>General secretory pathway signal peptides</B> were identified using consensus prediction of SignalP3.0-NN, SignalP3.0-HMM, Phobius and PrediSi. 
At least 3 of the above tools should have a positive prediction to confirm the consensus prediction. SignalP-NN's MaxD score and SignalP-HMM's 
cleavage probability were used to confirm the cleavage of general signal peptides.

both Effective 1.0.1 and T3SS_prediction should be positive with their scores greater than 0.8.</P><BR>
