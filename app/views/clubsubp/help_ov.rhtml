   <BR/><h5><br>ClubSub-P is clustering based meta-prediction of subcellular localization (SCL) database for Gram-negative bacterial proteins.<BR/></h5>
<P>Newly synthesized proteins have to be translocated to its native subcellular compartments for performin its native function. This protein sorting across the cytoplsmic memebrane in Gram-negative bacteria usually requires a short stretch of secretory signals which are present at the N-terminal region of proteins. But there are few secretory pathways in Gram-negative bacteria which does not require a secretory signal for secretion.</P></BR>

<P>In the post genomic era, SCL prediction is an impotant step in the functional annotation of proteins. The quality of secretory signal peptide predictions not only depends on the tools, but also depends on the quality of the input sequences. There are instance where the start codon is mis-predicted, a wrong N-terminal end which leads to a false positive or false negative signal peptide prediction. This further leads to a wrong SCL annotation.</P></BR>

<P>The mis-prediction of signal peptide due to the start codon prediction errors can be reduced by integrating the signal peptide prediction from closely related sequences. To achieve this 157 Gram-negative bacterial proteomes were clustered and N-terminal signal peptide and secondary structural features were predicted. Then SCL were assigned to proteins, which is later combined at cluster level to get SCL of the cluster.</P></BR>

   <P><B>Lipoprotein signal peptide</B>
      <BR>'Best prediction' in LipoP 1.0 was used to identify the <B>Lipoprotein signal peptides</B> in proteins. Since +2 retention signals are species specific and there is no enough experimental evidence to for a better classifier yet, so the sequence after SPII cleavage site was provided in the results for user's interpretation to predict which membrane(inner/outer) the protein binds.

   <P><B>TAT signal peptide</B>
      <BR>Both Tatp 1.0 and TatFind 1.4 should give a positive prediction to identify <B>twin argining translocation (TAT) signal peptides</B>. TatP's MaxD score was used to confirm the Tat peptide's cleavage.

   <P><B>General signal peptide</B>
      <BR><B>General secretory pathway signal peptides</B> were identified using consensus prediction of SignalP3.0-NN, SignalP3.0-HMM, Phobius and PrediSi. At least 3 of the above tools should have a positive prediction to confirm the consensus prediction. SignalP-NN's MaxD score and SignalP-HMM's cleavage probability were used to confirm the cleavage of general signal peptides.

      <BR>T3SS_prediction and Effective 1.0.1 were used to identify <B>T3SS signal peptides</B>. To reduce the false positive T3SS signal peptide prediction, both Effective 1.0.1 and T3SS_prediction should be positive with their scores greater than 0.8.</P><BR> 

<H3 class="<%= @section["name"]%>">Protein sorting rules for SCL annotation</H3>
   <H5>Periplasmic and Lipo proteins</H5>
      Proteins with general secretory pathway signal peptide or TAT signal peptides without TM domains were annotated periplasmic proteins. Proteins with lipoprotein signal peptide without TM domains were annotated outer/inner membrane lipoproteins.<BR/><BR/>

   <h5>Outer membrane &#946-barrel proteins</h5>
     Proteins with a positive general secretory pathway signal peptide or TAT signal peptide, with a positive prediction from PSORTbv3.0's outer membrane or CELLOv2.5's outer membrane and a positive prediction from HHOmp or BOMP were necessary to confirm the annotation as outer membrane &#946-barrel protein.<BR/><BR/>

   <H5>cytoplamic membrane proteins</H5>
      Consensus TMHs prediction module looks for a helix predicted by at least two TMH prediction tools (TMHMM, Phobius, HMMTOP), for a length of 10 amino acids. Proteins with one or more consensus TMH even after signal peptide cleavage were anotated cytoplasmic membrane proteins<BR/><BR/>

   <H5>Extracellular proteins</H5>
      Consensus T3SS signal peptide prediction or PSORTbv3.0's extracellular prediction were required to annotate extracellular proteins.<BR/><BR/>
