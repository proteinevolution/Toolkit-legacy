   <br/><h5><br>ClubSub-P is clustering based meta-prediction of subcellular localization (SCL) database for gram negative bacterial proteins.<br/></h5>
   <P>Newly synthesized proteins has to be translocated to its cellular compartments or secreted outside the cell for its normal function. This protein sorting across the cytoplsmic memebrane in gram negative bacteria usually requires a short stretch of secretory signals which are present at the N-terminal region of proteins. But there are few non-classical secretory pathways in gram negative bacteria which does  not require a secretory signal peptide for secretion across the inner membrane or both inner and outer membrane.</P><BR>
   <P>Secretory signal peptide prediction is an important step in subcellular localization prediction. The quality of these prediction not only depends on the tool, but also depends on the quality of the input sequence. There are instance where the start codon is mis-predicted, a wrong N-terminal end. This leads to a false positive or false negative signal peptide prediction and which leads to a wrong subcellular localization annotation.</P><BR>
   <P>The mis-prediction of signal peptide due to the start codon prediction errors can be reduced by integrating the signal peptide prediction from closely related sequences. To achieve this 157 gram negative bacterial proteomes were clustered and N-terminal signal peptide and  secondary structures were predicted for all the proteins and subcellular localization were assigned to proteins, which is later combined at cluster level to get cluster's subcellular localization.</P><BR>

   <P><B>Lipoprotein signal peptide</B>
      <BR>'Best prediction' in LipoP 1.0 was used to identify the <B>Lipoprotein signal peptides</B> in proteins. Since +2 retention signal is species specific and there is no better prediction for this, so the sequence after SPII cleavage site was provided in the results for user's interpretation to predict which membrane(inner/outer) the protein binds.

   <P><B>TAT signal peptide</B>
      <BR>Both Tatp 1.0 and TatFind 1.4 should give a positive prediction to identify <B>twin argining translocation (TAT) signal peptides</B>. TatP's MaxD score was used to confirm the Tat peptide's cleavage.

   <P><B>General signal peptide</B>
      <BR><B>General secretory pathway signal peptides</B> were identified using consensus prediction of SignalP3.0-NN, SignalP3.0-HMM, Phobius and PrediSi. At least 3 of the above tools should have a positive prediction to confirm the consensus prediction. SignalP-NN's MaxD score and SignalP-HMM's cleavage probability were used to confirm the cleavage of general signal peptides.

   <P><B>T3SS signal peptide</B>
      <BR>T3SS_prediction and Effective were used to identify <B>Type III secretion system peptides</B>. To reduce the false positive type III signal peptide prediction, T3SS was confirmed only when both Effective and T3SS_prediction were positive and their scores were also maximum.</P><BR> 

<H3 class="<%= @section["name"]%>">Rules of subcellular localization annotation</H3>
   <h5>Periplasmic and Lipo proteins</h5>
      Proteins with general secretory pathway signal peptide or TaT signal peptides without TM domains were annotated as periplasmic proteins. Proteins with lipoprotein signal peptide without TM domains were annotated as outer/inner membrane lipoproteins.<br/><br/>

   <h5>Outer membrane beta-barrel proteins</h5>
     Proteins with a positive general secretory pathway signal peptide or TAT signal peptide, with a positive prediction from PSORTbv3.0's outer membrane or CELLOv2.5's outer membrane and a positive prediction from HHOmp or BOMP were necessary to confirm the annotation as outer membrane beta-barrel protein.<br/><br/>

   <H5>Transmembrane Proteins</H5>
      Consenus TMHs prediction module needs at least 2 positive helix prediction for an amino acid position and this consensus TMH should  have a minimum length of 10aa to be assigned as consensus-TMH.<br/><br/>

   <H5>Extracellular Proteins</H5>
      Protiens with a consensus T3SS signal peptide prediction or PSORTbv3.0's extracellular prediction were required to annotate proteins as extracellular.<br/><br/>
